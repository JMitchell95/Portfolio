Portfolio assignment
Due to bad planning and unforseen events most of this assignment was done last minute. That being said I tried my best to make a good "About Me"page. I had to fiddle around with the rows and collums annd got a few of them to work the way I wanted. All in all I look forward to improving on this in the future,
